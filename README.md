# FFT-algorithm
In this repository I stored my FFT algorithm which I designed after the DSP study. Here I solved few assignment problems.

Write a MATLAB program to implement your radix-3 FFT algorithm for N = 27. You
should write a function to compute 3-point DFT and use it as a building block for generating results
for N = 27.
